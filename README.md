## Overview

This project offers a **modern, responsive C++ code editor in the browser** that leverages the versatile **Monaco Editor** for rich IDE-like code editing features combined with a robust backend powered by Next.js API routes. It supports rapid C++ code execution via secure remote compilation services or client-side WebAssembly techniques.

Key goals:
- Fast and responsive user experience
- Secure sandboxed code execution
- Clean, modern UI optimized for developers
- Extensible architecture for future real-time collaboration and multi-language support

---

## Features

- Fully featured Monaco Editor integration with C++ syntax highlighting, autocomplete, and error checking
- Run C++ code directly from the browser using a remote judge API (e.g., Judge0)
- Support for input/output in code execution
- Responsive UI with Tailwind CSS
- Simple file management with local storage (save/load code snippets)
- Extensible API routes for future backend enhancements
- Ready for deployment on Vercel or other Next.js platforms

---

## Tech Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js 15 (App Router)
- **Frontend:** React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Editor:** Monaco Editor (`@monaco-editor/react`)
- **Code Execution:** Judge0 API (remote compilation), planned WebAssembly support
- **Authentication & Storage:** (Optional) NextAuth.js, PostgreSQL, Prisma ORM
- **Deployment:** Vercel (recommended)

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >=18
- npm or yarn
- Judge0 API key (from RapidAPI)

### Installation

```

npx create-next-app@latest cpp-editor --typescript --tailwind --eslint --app
cd cpp-editor

npm install @monaco-editor/react

# optionally install prisma and next-auth if auth needed

```

### Environment Variables

Add a `.env.local` file with:

```

JUDGE0_API_KEY=your_rapidapi_key_here
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_secret_here
DATABASE_URL=your_database_url_here

```

---

## Usage

Run the development server:

```

npm run dev

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the editor in your browser.

Use the run button to execute C++ code and see output in the console panel.

---

## Architecture

- **Monaco Editor:** Rich code editing experience in the browser
- **Next.js API Routes:** Handle code execution and business logic
- **Judge0 API:** Secure sandbox for compiling and running C++ code
- **Frontend UI:** Responsive, minimalist design with loading and error states
- **Caching & Optimization:** Code/result caching to improve performance

## Code Execution Strategies

| Approach                | Speed | Security | Complexity | Cost  | Scalability | Offline Support |
| ----------------------- | ----- | -------- | ---------- | ----- | ----------- | -------------- |
| WebAssembly (client)    | 5/5   | 3/5      | 4/5        | 1/5   | 5/5         | Yes            |
| Remote API (Judge0)     | 3/5   | 5/5      | 2/5        | 3/5   | 4/5         | No             |
| Docker Containers       | 4/5   | 5/5      | 4/5        | 4/5   | 3/5         | No             |
| Serverless CloudFuncs   | 2/5   | 4/5      | 3/5        | 2/5   | 5/5         | No             |

*Choose your approach based on project needs and resources.*

---

## Security Considerations

- Validate and sanitize all code input
- Use sandboxed environments for code execution (Judge0, Docker)
- Apply rate limiting and timeout constraints
- Secure API routes with authentication if exposed publicly
- Serve everything over HTTPS only

---

## Performance Optimization

- Dynamic import of Monaco Editor to reduce bundle size
- Cache compilation results to avoid duplicate work
- Code splitting and lazy loading in Next.js
- Efficient backend API calls with maximum parallelism

---

## Roadmap & Future Enhancements

- User authentication and profile management
- Real-time collaboration (WebRTC or WebSocket powered)
- Multi-file virtual filesystem support with project management
- Built-in debugging tools integration
- Support for additional programming languages
- Offline compilation via WebAssembly
